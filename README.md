# Sql based-Libary Management System prject
 A SQL-based Library Management System designed to efficiently manage books, users, borrowing records, and library operations. This project provides a structured and optimized way to handle library data using SQL queries.


The Library Management System is designed to efficiently manage library resources, including books, members, borrowing records, and fines. The objective of this system is to:

✔️ Automate Library Operations – Streamline book borrowing, returning, and tracking processes.
✔️ Improve Data Management – Store and retrieve book and member details using structured SQL queries.
✔️ Enhance User Experience – Enable library staff to quickly manage books and user records.
✔️ Optimize Book Availability – Track issued and available books in real time.
✔️ Implement Fine Calculation – Automatically calculate overdue fines for late book returns.
✔️ Ensure Data Integrity – Use SQL constraints, indexing, and normalization for efficient database management.
